      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Nived P A, currently a third year undergraduate at Amrita University majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I&amp;rsquo;m also working as a Machine Learning intern at AfterShoot, a photo culling software tool for photographers. My main interests lie in domains related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning especially in the field of Computer Vision.
Experiences&amp;nbsp;¶ AfterShoot Inc. (November 2021 - Present)&amp;nbsp;¶ Working on implementing Machine Learning models and algorithms for rating photos based on numerous visual attributes so that photographers can get their best shots instantly and automatically.</description>

      <description>Academic Projects&amp;nbsp;¶ List of projects I have completed as a part of various courses taken in college.
  Classification and Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Medical Images (May 2021) Implemented a supervised Convolutional Neural Network for classification of medical images for detecting the presence of Covid/Pneumonia affected lung images. We noticed that the models used for similar purposes at the time only worked with good accuracy on the training datasets, whereas on a different dataset that contained similar CT Scan images the accuracy was reduced to 60-70%.</description>
