  Classification and Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Medical Images (May 2021) Implemented a supervised Convolutional Neural Network for classification of medical images for detecting the presence of Covid/Pneumonia affected lung images. We noticed that the models used for similar purposes at the time only worked with good accuracy on the training datasets, whereas on a different dataset that contained similar CT Scan images the accuracy was reduced to 60-70%."/>
