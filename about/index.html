<p>I was a student developer for TensorFlow organization and worked on a project to improve TF-GAN library. I worked on implementing a super-resolution GAN model named &lsquo;ESRGAN&rsquo; and a text-to-image translation model named ControlGAN. The main aim was to update the library with more recent variants of GANs that have more applications. I also wrote Google Colaboratory tutorial notebooks for end-to-end training of these models that explored various functionalities of TF-GAN.</p>
