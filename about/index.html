<p>At <a href="https://aftershoot.com/">AfterShoot</a> we make software for professional photographers to automate their workflow. We use Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms to perform photo culling, which involves selection of the desirable photos from a large group based on characteristics such as blur, duplicates, emotions, face sharpness and many more. I was also a part of a small team that made <a href="https://aftershoot.com/edit/">AfterShoot Edits</a>, which is an AI enabled editing app that learns the style of a particular user&rsquo;s edits and then apply edits according to their style on new photos. On a daily basis I work on mainly developing image processing algorithms, researching and implementing computer vision deep learning models and fine tuning them.</p>
<h3 id="tensorflow---google-summer-of-code-may-2021---august-2021">TensorFlow - Google Summer of Code (May 2021 - August 2021)</h3>
<p>Mentors : <a href="https://github.com/margaretmz">Margaret Maynard Reid</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/joel-shor">Joel Shor</a></p>
<p>I was a student developer for TensorFlow organization and worked on a project to improve TF-GAN library. I worked on implementing a super-resolution GAN model named ‘ESRGAN’ and a text-to-image translation model named ControlGAN. The main aim was to update the library with more recent variants of GANs that have more applications. I also wrote Google Colaboratory tutorial notebooks for end-to-end training of these models that explored various functionalities of TF-GAN.</p>
