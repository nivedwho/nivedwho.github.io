<p>List of projects I have completed as a part of various courses taken in college.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Classification and Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Medical Images (May 2021)</strong>      <br>
Implemented a supervised Convolutional Neural Network for classification of medical images for detecting the presence of Covid/Pneumonia affected lung images. We noticed that the models used for similar purposes at the time only worked with good accuracy on the training datasets, whereas on a different dataset that contained similar CT Scan images the accuracy was reduced to 60-70%. To improve the robustness of our model we implemented a voting based approach that considers multiple images of the same person as a single group and also performed cross-data analysis. <em>This was done as the project work for the course 19MAT212 :&lsquo;Mathematics for Intelligent Systems 4&rsquo;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Twitter Data Analysis (May 2021)</strong><br>
Implemented a LSTM based model for classifying the authenticity of covid related tweets. Dataset containing the tweets was extracted using Twitter API. <em>This was done as the project work for the course 19AIE214:&lsquo;Big Data Analytics&rsquo;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compressing Genome sequences using Burrows Wheeler Transformation (December 2020)</strong>
Implemented a python program that can performs BWT on very large genome sequences and run length encoding was done for compression. Test was done on a Coronavirus dataset. <em>This was done as the project work for the course 19BIO201:&lsquo;Intelligence of Biological Systems 3&rsquo;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Effective Health Monitoring Device (May 2020)</strong><br>
Proposed a prototype for a wearable health monitoring device particularly useful for people during the pandemic times. This paper was accepted for COCONet conference 2020. <em>This was done as the project work for the course 19AIE114: Principles of Measurements and Sensors</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applications of Fourier Transformation for Image Processing (April 2020)</strong><br>
Implemented a MATLAB application that computes FFT and inverse FFT of an input image and performed edge detection and image de-noising.
<em>This was done as the project work for the course 19MAT117:&lsquo;Mathematics for Intelligent Systems 2&rsquo;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MATLAB based GUI application to find the Centroid and Moment of Inertia of any input shape. (December 2019)</strong><br>
Implemented a MATLAB program that can compute the Centroid and Moment of Inertia of an input shape, a GUI was implemented asking users about the input shape and its dimensions.
<em>This was done as the project work for the course 19PHY104:&lsquo;Computational Engineering Mechanics 1&rsquo;</em>.</p>
